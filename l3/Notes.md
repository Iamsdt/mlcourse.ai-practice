# Defination
```
A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.
```

In the various problem settings T, P, and E can refer to completely different things. Some of the most popular tasks T in machine learning are the following:

- classification of an instance to one of the categories based on its features;
- regression – prediction of a numerical target feature based on other features of an instance;
- clustering – identifying partitions of instances based on the features of these instances so that the members within the groups are more similar to each other than those in the other groups;
- anomaly detection – search for instances that are "greatly dissimilar" to the rest of the sample or to some group of instances;
- and so many more.
